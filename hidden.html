<div class="w3-container" id="passion" style="padding-bottom:32px;">
  <article>
    <p>For the longest time, I was certain that my passion was in medicine.</p>
    <p>But, as you might have noticed, passions change. (I think a more fitting way to say this is that passions get refined.)</p>
    <p>A quick glance at my resume might suggest that I am simply following the laws of entropy, 
      however, I promise there is a method to my madness.</p>
    <p>I've always been captivated by science, specifically the application of chemistry to develop medicine.
       And so, I pursued a B.S. in Nanoengineering and Chemistry at UCSD. Throughout my time as both a student, 
       I was briefly exposed to computer science and wondered if I should change majors. I decided against this, 
       and was determined to see things through. I interned at several biotech companies and began working as a researcher. 
       Through this experience, I further refined my strengths and interests. I developed soft skills as a project manager, 
       and learned to analyze large, multidimensional datasets using Python.</p>
    <p> While I am grateful for my experiences in life sciences, I realized that it was time for a change. 
      My next steps from there were to get my CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification, 
      and to establish fundamentals in programming by pursuing a second B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University.</p>
    <p> I hope to use these combined experiences to bridge the gap between computer science and life science. 
      As a former scientist, I can understand and empathize with their needs when it comes to applications used in research. 
      Moreover, as I'm learning more about computer science (data structures, algorithms, web development, databases), 
      I am confident in my abilities to translate user needs into detailed requirements to guide the development 
      and implementation of new programs.</p>
