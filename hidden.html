    <img src="./images/dreamworld.png" width="500" height="auto">
    <p>For the longest time, I was certain that my passion was in medicine.</p>
    <p>As you might have noticed (or experienced for yourself), passions change.</p>
    <p>A quick glance at my resume might suggest that I am simply following the laws of entropy.<br>
      However, I promise there is a method to my madness.</p>
    <p>Science is a form of magic. Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to leverage my understanding of the world and 
      collaborate with others to make new innovations. I earned my B.S. in Nanoengineering and Chemistry at UCSD
      and worked in the research & development of: cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pain.</p>

    <p>Throughout my time as both a student and researcher, I further refined my strengths and interests. 
      I developed soft skills as a project manager, and learned to analyze large, multidimensional datasets using Python.
      While I am grateful for my experiences in life sciences, I realized that it was time for a change. 
      My next steps from there were to get my CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification, 
      and to establish fundamentals in programming by pursuing a second B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University.</p>
      
    <p>I will use these combined experiences to help develop tools that researchers can use to streamline their work: everything from 
      documenting experiments in detail to analyzing complex datasets. As a former scientist, I can understand and empathize with 
      their needs. Moreover, as I'm learning more about computer science (data structures, algorithms, web development, databases), 
      I am confident in my abilities to translate user needs into detailed requirements to guide the development 
      and implementation of new programs.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to learn more about my past experiences, you can find my CV <a href="./experience.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to get more details about specific projects, you can go <a href="./projects.html">here</a>.</p>
